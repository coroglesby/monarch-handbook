<h4 id="existing-reservations">Finding, Editing, and Cancelling Existing Reservations</h4>

<p>The quickest way to find an existing (past, future, or cancelled) reservation is to click the Dashboard tab and use the Text Search field to search by name, reservation number, phone number, etc. Information within a reservation folio can be edited by clicking the small pencil icon in the box field. The room can be changed or moved by clicking on the small house icon in the top right. The pencil on the top right will allow you to edit the check in/out dates, the number of guests, the room price, and add or remove tax from the price.</p>

<p>The “Cancel Booking” in the top corner will cancel the booking. Cancelling will remove the booking from the calendar and free the room, but the original reservation will remain searchable in Sirvoy. Please always make a note in the “Internal Comments” box if canceling a reservation with any pertinent information.</p>

<p>Please note the cancellation policy as listed online and in guest confirmation email. Reservations may be cancelled without penalty up to 24 hours in advance of your stay, excluding University Event Weekends during which we require 30 days cancellation notice. University Events weekends include events such as Graduations, Homecomings, Mom, Dad, and Parent weekends, Apple Cup. Reservations not cancelled in the applicable time frame will be charged a cancellation fee equal to one night’s stay. Please contact the front desk if you have any questions about cancellations.</p>

<h4 id="new-reservations">Creating a New Reservation</h4>

<p>In Sirvoy, room rates can be checked by clicking the “Rates” tab and selecting on the calendar or scrolling to the date you’d like to view. Guests can book rooms online at <a href="http://www.moscowmonarch.com">www.moscowmonarch.com</a> or over the phone.</p>

<p>To book via phone, click on the “New Bookings” tab and select the desired dates in the room search. The results returned will be all of the available rooms. Select the necessary rooms and any extras(rollway, pet fee) and click the “Next” button. Enter the guest information and click “Book Now.” <strong>IMPORTANT: The reservation is now created but you still NEED to get credit card information.</strong> In the new reservation folio, click on the plus Icon in the “Card Details” field and enter in their credit card. ALL Reservations (unless cleared by Nikki, Brett, or Matt) Must have a valid card attached. If you would like to add a promo code, this can be done after the reservation is created by clicking the pencil icon in the “Promo Code” field.</p>

<p>The guest will receive an automatic email confirming their reservation, after you click “Book Now”. If you want to make any changes to their information or add a promo code before the automatic email gets sent, click on the “Do not send confirmation email" button located under the phone number. This is preferred to allow you to verify all information is correct prior to sending an email (system does it automatically if you don’t click the box). If the guest would like another confirmation email, or change their reservation and need a new confirmation email, you may send one by clicking the “Send Email” button and selecting the “Booking Confirmation Template” from the drop down menu. You may also click the “Print Specification” button and download a PDF of the reservation to attach to an email (if you were already emailing the guest back and forth in Gmail).</p>

<p>Once you click and open a reservation, be familiar with all contents and options. We can add/change promo discounts or even prices at any time. This may occur when we learn a guest deserves one at check in, or over the phone. Actively seek ways to accommodate the guest.</p>
