<h2 id="intro">The Monarch Motel Standing Operating Procedures (SOP)</h2>

<p>This SOP is a living document. We adjust and refine this based off what we learn as a staff and organization.  Please write in comments and suggestions for management to review and incorporate. This supports the other documents that show the Monarch Vision and Employee information.</p>

<p>As a reminder for this SOP, to keep in mind... Our motel exists to serve guests.  We create the best lodging experience we can with our staff and facility. Each of us is responsible for this.  As a business, we stay financial viable by occupying rooms with new and existing guests. Get to know them, be polite and respectful, be enjoyable.  Room rates are set to the market and to our potential customer base. This depends on many variables, from season to day of week. It costs us about $40 to sustain one room (housekeeping, wages, materiel, operating expenses, etc.).  Keep all this in mind as we work to increase our occupancy rate.</p>

<p>This SOP intends to help us operate more efficiently for our guests and as a business organization.  Thank you!</p>
